Overview
========
This example demonstrates usage of eRPC between PC and board using UART transport layer.
Board acts like a server and the PC as client. When server starts, it waits for
data being send from client over UART. Server then performs action (DAC/ADC conversion, light LEDs,
read data from magnetometer senzor) and sends result data back to client (or lights LED).

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Download the program to the target board.
3.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
4.  Run "run.py" on your PC and select COM port.

For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.
